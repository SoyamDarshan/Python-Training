Give three examples of life-critical software applications.



Medicine
The technology requirements can go beyond avoidance of failure, and can even facilitate medical intensive care (which deals with healing patients), and also life support (which is for stabilizing patients).

Heart-lung machines
Mechanical ventilation systems
Infusion pumps and Insulin pumps
Radiation therapy machines
Robotic surgery machines
Defibrillator machines
Dialysis machines
Devices that electronically monitor vital functions (electrography; especially, electrocardiography, ECG or EKG, and electroencephalography, EEG)
Medical imaging devices (X ray, computerized tomography- CT or CAT, different magnetic resonance imaging- MRI- techniques, positron emission tomography- PET)
Even healthcare information systems have significant safety implications [12]


Nuclear engineering
Nuclear reactor control systems
